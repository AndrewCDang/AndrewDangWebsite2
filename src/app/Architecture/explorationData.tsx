            I explored Philippe Rahm's groundbreaking project, which applied
            advanced climatic technology to control outdoor environments,
            extending indoor climate management outdoors as a solution to
            climate change's rising temperatures.

            Rahm used computational fluid dynamics to identify low-heat,
            humidity, and pollution areas, enhancing these with climatic
            devices. This created "Climatic Pathways," offering varied climatic
            experiences. Rahm's innovative approach aimed to redefine
            architecture through weather processes, creating a vibrant mix of
            climatic conditions and experiences through continuous climate
            modulation.

                            Ozone Eclipse devices reduce pollution by absorbing
                            harmful gases such as aerosols, nitrogen oxides and
                            ozone. Pre-industrial draught devices filter out
                            PM10 and PM2.5 particles in the air. Cleaning
                            devices then blow out clean air.
